[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_plugins.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_plugins", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_plugins"
  with any of the following names:

    gazebo_pluginsConfig.cmake
    gazebo_plugins-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_plugins" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_plugins_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gazebo_plugins" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
